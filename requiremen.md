# Port Management System Requirements

## Overview
A dynamic port allocation system designed to manage concurrent Flask projects, enabling developers to run multiple instances without port conflicts. The system provides automated port management, configuration, and monitoring capabilities for development, testing, and production environments.

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Port Allocation
- Automatic detection of available ports within configurable ranges
- Persistent port assignments for specific project instances
- Support for both automatic and manual port assignment
- Port conflict resolution with configurable fallback strategies
- Ability to reserve specific ports for critical services

### 1.2 Configuration Management
- Project-specific configuration files for port settings
- Environment-specific configuration (dev, test, prod)
- Instance-specific configuration for multiple instances of the same project
- Command-line interface for overriding configuration settings
- Support for configuration inheritance and overrides

### 1.3 Project Integration
- Minimal-invasive integration with existing Flask projects
- Support for Flask application factory pattern
- Compatibility with common Flask extensions and deployment methods
- Standardized configuration interface for port-dependent services

### 1.4 Service Discovery
- Registry of running services and their assigned ports
- API for discovering service endpoints
- Support for service dependencies and startup order
- Health checking for dependent services

### 1.5 Monitoring and Management
- Web interface for viewing active services and their ports
- Command-line tools for managing service instances
- Port usage statistics and recommendations
- Logging of port assignments and conflicts

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Performance
- Minimal overhead when starting applications
- Fast port availability checking
- Efficient handling of multiple concurrent service startups

### 2.2 Reliability
- Consistent port assignments across restarts
- Graceful handling of port conflicts
- Proper cleanup of port registrations when services terminate

### 2.3 Usability
- Simple developer workflow for common tasks
- Clear documentation and examples
- Intuitive command-line interface
- Minimal configuration for basic use cases

### 2.4 Scalability
- Support for dozens of concurrent service instances
- Configurable port ranges for different service types
- Distributed port management for team development environments

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Core Components
- Port allocation service with persistence
- Configuration management system
- Service registry and discovery mechanism
- Command-line interface for management
- Web dashboard for monitoring (optional)

### 3.2 Implementation
- Python 3.9+ compatibility
- Minimal external dependencies
- Support for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms
- Containerization support (Docker)

### 3.3 Integration Points
- Flask application integration
- Support for other WSGI frameworks (optional)
- Database service integration
- Caching service integration
- Message queue integration

## 4. Development Process
1. Define the port management API and interfaces
2. Implement core port allocation and persistence
3. Create configuration management system
4. Develop service registry and discovery
5. Build command-line interface
6. Create integration examples for Flask applications
7. Implement web dashboard for monitoring (optional)
8. Write comprehensive documentation and examples

## 5. Deliverables
- Port management library with Python API
- Command-line tools for port management
- Configuration templates and examples
- Integration examples for Flask applications
- Documentation and user guides
- Web dashboard for monitoring (optional)

## 6. Version Control
- All code should be maintained in a Git repository
- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Maintain a detailed changelog

## 7. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests for Flask application integration
- Performance testing for concurrent operations
- Cross-platform testing
- Test coverage minimum of 80%

## 8. Documentation Requirements
- API documentation
- User guides
- Installation instructions
- Configuration examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Contributing guidelines
