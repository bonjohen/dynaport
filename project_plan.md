## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Port conflicts with other applications | High | Implement configurable port ranges and fallback strategies |
| Performance overhead | Medium | Optimize port checking and minimize startup impact |
| Cross-platform compatibility issues | Medium | Comprehensive testing on all target platforms |
| Integration complexity with existing projects | High | Create simple integration patterns and thorough documentation |
| Security concerns with service discovery | Medium | Implement proper authentication and limit network exposure |

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully manage concurrent Flask applications without port conflicts
2. Minimal configuration required for basic usage
3. Comprehensive documentation and examples
4. Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
5. Performance overhead less than 500ms for application startup
